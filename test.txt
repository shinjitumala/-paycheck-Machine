#
# How to use:
#
# It's easy!
# 1. Put both auto_type.exe and test.txt (Or any file that has the appropriate data in it.) in the same folder.
# 2. Configure the schedule to your liking.
#    How the schedule data table works:
#    schedule data starts with ":schedule" and ends with ":endschedule" so make sure to put the data in between them.
#    The schedule for a day in a week is written between "(A day of the week)" and "(A day of the week)END". For example, for Monday it is between "MON" and "ENDMON".
#    Here is the important part. Now, times have to be written in pairs. For example, if you want the program to type between 9am and 10:30am you must write
#
#    9.0
#    10.5
#
#    Note that the data is written in 24 hours. So if you want to write 8:15pm it would be 20.25
#
#    !! WARNING !! DO NOT PUT ANY EMPTY LINES INSIDE THE DAY SCHEDULE OR THE PROGRAM CANNOT INTERPTET THE DATA.
#
#    !! WARNING !! ALSO MAKE SURE THAT THE TIME SHCEDULES ARE WRITTEN IN PAIRS. OTHERWISE YOU ARE GOING TO RUN IN TO PROBLEMS.
#
# 3. Configure the output text. This one is explained in the bottom where :data is.
# 4. Open your command prompt. You can open it by pressing "Windows key" + "S" then type "cmd" (without the quotes) and press "Enter".
# 5. Now use the cd command to go to the directory where you have auto_type.exe
#    For example, if auto_type.exe is in "C:Users\Piggy\Desktop\" , then you must type "cd C:" and then type "cd Users\Piggy\Desktop"
#    You can check the directory of the auto_type.exe by right clicking it and click properties. A new window will show up and it will show the file path.
# 6. Now go to the command prompt and type "./auto_type.exe schedule.txt" (For advanced users: You can also use other files provided they have the appropriate data!)
# 7. Enjoy your EZ auction money.
