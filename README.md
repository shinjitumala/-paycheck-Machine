# -paycheck-Machine
My old $paycheck program. No longer in use. Uploaded for the archives.

# Features 
* Type "$paycheck" or any other string in a random interval between the maximum and minimum time. 
* A schedule system where it will only type during the hours in a week specified in an external text file.
* _Experimental:_ Typo simulation.

# My notes
I used this program to get me some free virtual items and didn't get detected as scripting for about a month.
But it quickly became useless as it required you to open the app you want to type in then leave it like that 24/7.
Did not want to shorten the lifespan of my laptop so I stopped using it.
Starting to work on an improved version from scratch. Meaning that this project is abandoned forever. (2018 June)
